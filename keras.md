Keras is a high level library for building neural networks able to use both TensorFlow and Theano as a backend. 
That is, it can use either library to actually run the networks.

Keras is being rolled into TensorFlow in the tf.layers module. 
So, while we'll be using TensorFlow in the projects, you can build networks the same way you would with Keras.
